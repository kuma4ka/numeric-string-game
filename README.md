# numeric-string-game
At the beginning of the game, the human-player indicates the length of the numerical string to be used in the game, which can be in the range of 15 to 25 numbers. The game software randomly generates a numerical string from 1 to 6 of the specified length. 

At the beginning of the game, the generated numerical string is given. Players alternate moves. Each player has 0 points. During the turn, the player can: 
 - sum up a pair of numbers (the first with the second, the third with the fourth, the fifth with the sixth) and replace the pair of numbers by their sum  (if the sum is greater than 6, then substitutions are made: 7 = 1, 8 = 2, 9 = 3, 10 = 4, 11=5, 12=6), as well as add 1 point to his score;
 - delete the number that is left without a pair and subtract two points from the opponent's score. 
 
The game ends when one number remains in the string. The player with the higher number of points wins.
